# Resume Data Analysis

This dataset contains experimental data from a study seeking to understand factors that influence whether or not a resume is selected for a callback. This experiment data comes from a study that sought to understand the influence of race and gender on job application callback rates. The study monitored job postings in Boston and Chicago for several months during 2001 and 2002 and used this to build up a set of test cases. Over this time period, the researchers randomly generating resumes to go out to a job posting, such as years of experience and education details, to create a realistic-looking resume. They then randomly assigned a name to the resume that would communicate the applicant's gender and race. The first names chosen for the study were selected so that the names would predominantly be recognized as belonging to black or white individuals. For example, Lakisha was a name that their survey indicated would be interpreted as a black woman, while Greg was a name that would generally be interpreted to be associated with a white male.
